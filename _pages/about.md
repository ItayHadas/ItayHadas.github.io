My research has been focused on the brain mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders, with the goal of developing innovative and more effective diagnostics and therapeutics to improve patients' quality of life. A significant part of my work is dedicated to identifying neurophysiological depression biomarkers capable of predicting clinical outcomes and supporting decision-making in neurostimulation trials. I have been deeply involved in research utilizing a range of neuromodulatory technologies, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), magnetic seizure therapy (MST), and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to treat conditions such as depression, OCD, ADHD, and bipolar disorder. My expertise in neurophysiology and brain imaging analysis has been instrumental in refining brain stimulation targeting and optimizing brain stimulation efficacy.
I have served as principal and co-investigator on multimillion-dollar clinical trials, with roles in clinical trial management, regulatory compliance (FDA, IRB), training, and mentorship. By bridging computational neuroscience with translational research, I aim to advance precision neuropsychiatric interventions and contribute to next-generation diagnostics through a deeper understanding of brain and behavior.
