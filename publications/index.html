One source of this variability can be the influence of the phase and power of pre-stimulus neuronal oscillations on single-trial TMS responses. Here, we investigate the effect of brain oscillatory activity on TMS response in 49 distinct healthy participants (64 datasets) who had received single-pulse TMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Across all frequency bands of theta (4–7 Hz), alpha (8–13 Hz), and beta (14–30 Hz), there was no significant effect of pre-TMS phase on single-trial cortical evoked activity. After high-powered oscillations, whether followed by a TMS pulse or not, the subsequent activity was larger than after low-powered oscillations. We further defined a measure, corrected_effect, to enable us to investigate brain responses to the TMS pulse disentangled from the power of ongoing (spontaneous) oscillations. The corrected_effect was significantly different from zero (meaningful added effect of TMS) only in theta and beta bands. Our results suggest that brain state prior to stimulation might play some role in shaping the subsequent TMS-EEG response. Specifically, our findings indicate that the power of ongoing oscillatory activity, but not phase, can influence brain responses to TMS. Aligning the TMS pulse with specific power thresholds of an EEG signal might therefore reduce variability in neurophysiological measurements and also has the potential to facilitate more robust therapeutic effects of stimulation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="smith_magnetic_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Magnetic seizure therapy and electroconvulsive therapy increase frontal aperiodic activity</div> <div class="author"> Sydney E.

Here, we analysed fundamental temporal features of microstates extracted from the broadband EEG signal in a large (N = 139) cohort of children spanning early-to-middle childhood (4–12 years of age). Linear regression models were used to examine if participants’ age and biological sex could predict the temporal parameters GEV, duration, coverage, and occurrence, for five microstate classes (A–E) across both eyes-closed and eyes-open resting-state recordings. We further explored associations between these microstate parameters and posterior alpha power after removal of the 1/f-like aperiodic signal. The microstates obtained from our neurodevelopmental EEG recordings broadly replicated the four canonical microstate classes (A to D) frequently reported in adults, with the addition of the more recently established microstate class E. Biological sex served as a significant predictor in the regression models for four of the five microstate classes (A, C, D, and E). In addition, duration and occurrence for microstate E were both found to be positively associated with age for the eyes-open recordings, while the temporal parameters of microstates C and E both exhibited associations with alpha band spectral power. Together, these findings highlight the influence of age and sex on large-scale functional brain networks during early-to-middle childhood, extending understanding of neural dynamics across this important period for brain development.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="poorganji_isolating_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Isolating sensory artifacts in the suprathreshold TMS-EEG signal over DLPFC</div> <div class="author"> Mohsen Poorganji, Reza Zomorrodi, Colin Hawco, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 8 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '8 more authors' ?

To further characterize the TMS-evoked potential (TEP) generated with TMS-EEG, beyond the motor cortex, we aimed to distinguish between cortical reactivity to TMS versus non-specific somatosensory and auditory co-activations using both single-pulse and paired-pulse protocols at suprathreshold stimulation intensities over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Fifteen right-handed healthy participants received six blocks of stimulation including single and paired TMS delivered as active-masked (i.e., TMS-EEG with auditory masking and foam spacing), active-unmasked (TMS-EEG without auditory masking and foam spacing) and sham (sham TMS coil). We evaluated cortical excitability following single-pulse TMS, and cortical inhibition following a paired-pulse paradigm (long-interval cortical inhibition (LICI)). Repeated measure ANOVAs revealed significant differences in mean cortical evoked activity (CEA) of active-masked, active-unmasked, and sham conditions for both the single-pulse (F(1.76, 24.63) = 21.88, p \textless 0.001, η2 = 0.61) and LICI (F(1.68, 23.49) = 10.09, p \textless 0.001, η2 = 0.42) protocols. Furthermore, global mean field amplitude (GMFA) differed significantly across the three conditions for both single-pulse (F(1.85, 25.89) = 24.68, p \textless 0.001, η2 = 0.64) and LICI (F(1.8, 25.16) = 14.29, p \textless 0.001, η2 = 0.5). Finally, only active LICI protocols but not sham stimulation ([active-masked (0.78 ± 0.16, P \textless 0.0001)], [active-unmasked (0.83 ± 0.25, P \textless 0.01)]) resulted in significant signal inhibition. While previous findings of a significant somatosensory and auditory contribution to the evoked EEG signal are replicated by our study, an artifact attenuated cortical reactivity can reliably be measured in the TMS-EEG signal with suprathreshold stimulation of DLPFC. Artifact attenuation can be accomplished using standard procedures, and even when masked, the level of cortical reactivity is still far above what is produced by sham stimulation. Our study illustrates that TMS-EEG of DLPFC remains a valid investigational tool.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="poorganji_masking_2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Masking sensory artifacts in single and paired-pulse suprathreshold TMS-EEG of DLPFC</div> <div class="author"> Mohsen Poorganji, Reza Zomorrodi, Colin Hawco, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 7 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '7 more authors' ?

Methods Fourteen neurotypical participants took part in the following three experimental conditions: 600, 1200 and 1800 pulses. TMS-EEG recordings were conducted on the left DLPFC pre/post iTBS, including single-pulse TMS and short- and long-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI, LICI). TMS-evoked potentials (TEP) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) were quantified. Linear mixed models were used to assess the effect of iTBS on brain activity. Results The effects of iTBS on DLPFC activity did not significantly differ between the three doses. Specifically, regardless of dose, iTBS modulated the amplitude of most TEP components (P30, N45, P60, P200), reduced SICI and LICI ratios of P30 and P200, and decreased ERSP power of theta oscillations. Conclusions In neurotypical individuals, doubling or tripling the number of iTBS pulses does not result in stronger potentiation of prefrontal activity. However, all iTBS conditions induced significant modulations of DLPFC activity.

Another seizure therapy under development is magnetic seizure therapy (MST), which could potentially overcome the restrictions associated with ECT with similar efficacy. The neurophysiological targets and mechanisms of seizure therapy, however, remain poorly understood. This neurophysiological study protocol is published as a companion to the overall Confirmatory Efficacy and Safety Trial of Magnetic Seizure Therapy for Depression (CREST-MST) protocol that describes our two-site, double-blind, randomized, non-inferiority clinical trial to develop MST as an effective and safe treatment for TRD. Our aim for the neurophysiological component of the study is to evaluate two biomarkers, one to predict remission of suicidal ideation (primary outcome) and the other to predict cognitive impairment (secondary outcome). Suicidal ideation will be assessed through cortical inhibition, which according to our preliminary studies, correlates with remission of suicidal ideation. Cortical inhibition will be measured with simultaneous transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG), TMS-EEG, which measures TMS-evoked EEG activity. Cognitive adverse effects associated with seizure therapy, on the contrary, will be evaluated via multiscale entropy analysis reflecting the complexity of ongoing resting-state EEG activity. ECT and MST are known to influence cortical inhibition associated with depression, suicidal ideation severity, and clinical outcome. Therefore, evaluating cortical inhibition and brain temporal dynamics will help understand the pathophysiology of depression and suicidal ideation and define new biological targets that could aid clinicians in diagnosing and selecting treatments. Resting-state EEG complexity was previously associated with the degree of cognitive side effects after a seizure therapy. This neurophysiological metric may help clinicians assess the risk for adverse effects caused by these useful and effective treatments. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03191058 .

We measured transcranial magnetic stimulation evoked interhemispheric signal propagation (ISP), a non-invasive measure of transcallosal connectivity, and hypothesized that the SCZ and MDD groups will have increased ISP compared to healthy controls. Methods We evaluated ISP over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in 34 patients with SCZ and 34 patients with MDD compared to 32 age and sex-matched healthy controls. Results ISP was significantly increased in patients with SCZ and patients with MDD compared to healthy controls but did not differ between patient groups. There were no effects of antidepressant, antipsychotic, and benzodiazepine medications on ISP and our results remained unchanged after re-analysis with a region of interest method. Conclusion Altered ISP was found in both SCZ and MDD patient groups. This indicates that disruptions of interhemispheric signaling processes can be indexed with ISP across psychiatric populations. Significance These findings enhance our knowledge of the physiological mechanisms of interhemispheric imbalances in SCZ and MDD, which may serve as potential treatment targets in future patients.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="hill_characterizing_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Characterizing Cortical Oscillatory Responses in Major Depressive Disorder Before and After Convulsive Therapy: A TMS-EEG Study</div> <div class="author"> Aron T.

Here, we utilized time-frequency analyses to characterize differences in neural oscillatory dynamics between subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls (HC). We further examined changes in TMS-related oscillatory power following convulsive therapy. Methods Oscillatory power was examined following TMS over the dorsolateral prefrontal and motor cortices (DLPFC and M1) in 38 MDD subjects, and 22 HCs. We further investigated how these responses changed in the MDD group following an acute course of convulsive therapy (either magnetic seizure therapy [MST, n = 24] or electroconvulsive therapy [ECT, n = 14]). Results Prior to treatment, MDD subjects exhibited increased oscillatory power within delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands with TMS-EEG over the DLPFC, but showed no differences to HCs with stimulation over M1. Following MST, DLPFC stimulation revealed attenuated baseline-normalized power in the delta and theta bands, with reductions in the delta, theta, and alpha power following ECT. TMS over M1 revealed reduced delta and theta power following ECT, with no changes observed following MST. An association was also observed between the treatment- induced change in alpha power and depression severity score. Limitations Limitations include the modest sample size, open-label MST and ECT treatment designs, and lack of a placebo condition. Conclusions These results provide evidence of alterations in TMS-related oscillatory activity in MDD, and further suggest modulation of oscillatory power following ECT and MST.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="poorganji_differentiating_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Differentiating transcranial magnetic stimulation cortical and auditory responses via single pulse and paired pulse protocols: A TMS-EEG study</div> <div class="author"> Mohsen Poorganji, Reza Zomorrodi, Colin Hawco, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 8 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '8 more authors' ?

Methods Nineteen healthy subjects received active and sham (coil 90° tilted and touching the scalp) SP and PP TMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We measured excitability through SP TMS and inhibition (i.e., cortical inhibition (CI)) through PP TMS. Results Cortical excitability indexed by area under the curve (AUC(25-275ms)) was significantly higher in the active compared to sham stimulation (F(1,18) = 43.737, p \textless 0.001, η2 = 0.708). Moreover, the amplitude of N100-P200 complex was significantly larger (F(1,18) = 9.118, p \textless 0.01, η2 = 0.336) with active stimulation (10.38 ± 9.576 µV) compared to sham (4.295 ± 2.323 µV).

Finally, only active stimulation (CI = 0.64 ± 0.23, p \textless 0.001) resulted in significant cortical inhibition. Conclusion The significant differences between active and sham stimulation in both excitatory and inhibitory neurophysiological responses showed that active stimulation elicits responses from the cortex that are different from the non-specific effects of sham stimulation.

Methods 54 healthy and 57 ADHD adults participated in the study. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded when combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the right prefrontal cortex and also recorded during the Stop Signal task. Results TMS evoked potentials (TEPs) and the event related potential (ERP) components in the Stop Signal task were found to be significantly reduced in ADHD relative to the matched healthy controls. Stop signal reaction time (SSRT) and stopping accuracy was found to correlate with the ERP signal, and ADHD severity correlated with the TEP signal. Cortical activity (early TEP and Stop Signal ERP) diagnostic model yielded accuracy of 72%. Conclusion TEPs and ERPs reveal that right PFC excitability was associated with ADHD severity, and with behavioral impulsivity – as a hallmark of ADHD pathology. This electrophysiological biomarker supports the potential of objective diagnosis for ADHD.

The effects of antidepressants on SI across the entire sample of the STAR*D trial has never been investigated. We performed a secondary analysis of the STAR*D data with the primary outcome of change in score on the suicide item (item three) of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD17) across all four study levels. We used descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses. Pearson correlation was used for change in SI versus change in depression (HRSD16). Reduction in mean (SD) SI was greater in levels one: 0.29 (±0.78) (p \textless 0.001) and two: 0.26 (±0.88) (p \textless 0.001) than in levels three: 0.16 (±0.92) (p = 0.005) and four: 0.18 (±0.93) (p = 0.094). A history of past suicide attempts (OR 1.72, p = 0.007), comorbid medical illness (OR 2.23, p = 0.005), and a family history of drug abuse (OR 1.69, p = 0.008) were correlated with worsening of SI across level one.

Indirect evidence also links hippocampal activation to the cognitive side effects of seizure treatments. Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a novel treatment for patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD). Here we combine transcranial magnetic stimulation with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) to evaluate the effects of MST on connectivity and activation between the DLPFC, the SGC and hippocampus (Hipp) in patients with TRD. The TMS-EEG was collected from 31 TRD patients prior to and after an MST treatment trial. Through TMS-EEG methodology we evaluated significant current scattering (SCS) as an index of effective connectivity between the SGC and left DLPFC. Significant current density (SCD) was used to assess activity at the level of the Hipp. The SCS between the SGC and DLPFC was reduced after the course of MST (p \textless 0.036). The DLPFC-SGC effective connectivity reduction correlated with the changes in Hamilton depression score pre-to-post treatment (R = 0.46; p \textless 0.031). The SCD localized to the Hipp was reduced after the course of MST (p \textless 0.015), and the SCD change was correlated with montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA) scores pre-post the course of MST (R = −0.59; p \textless 0.026). Our findings suggest that MST treatment is associated with SGC-DLPFC connectivity reduction and that changes to cognition are associated with Hipp activation reduction. These findings demonstrate two distinct processes which drive efficacy and side effects separately, and might eventually aid in delineating physiological TRD targets in clinical settings.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="hill_modulation_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Modulation of functional network properties in major depressive disorder following electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): a resting-state EEG analysis</div> <div class="author"> Aron T.

Presently, however, understanding of its neurophysiological effects remains incomplete. In the present study, we utilised resting-state electroencephalography (RS-EEG) to explore changes in functional connectivity, network topology, and spectral power elicited by an acute open-label course of ECT in a cohort of 23 patients with treatment-resistant MDD. RS-EEG was recorded prior to commencement of ECT and again within 48 h following each patient’s final treatment session. Our results show that ECT was able to enhance connectivity within lower (delta and theta) frequency bands across subnetworks largely confined to fronto-central channels, while, conversely, more widespread subnetworks of reduced connectivity emerged within faster (alpha and beta) bands following treatment. Graph-based topological analyses revealed changes in measures of functional segregation (clustering coefficient), integration (characteristic path length), and small-world architecture following ECT. Finally, post-treatment enhancement of delta and theta spectral power was observed, which showed a positive association with the number of ECT sessions received. Overall, our findings indicate that RS-EEG can provide a sensitive measure of dynamic neural activity following ECT and highlight network-based analyses as a promising avenue for furthering mechanistic understanding of the effects of convulsive therapies.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="hill_resting-state_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Resting-state electroencephalographic functional network alterations in major depressive disorder following magnetic seizure therapy</div> <div class="author"> Aron T.

However, the underlying mechanism of action of MST remains uncertain. Here, we used resting-state electroencephalography (RS-EEG) to characterise the physiological effects of MST for treatment resistant MDD. We recorded RS-EEG in 21 patients before and after an open label trial of MST applied over the prefrontal cortex using a bilateral twin coil. RS-EEG was analysed for changes in functional connectivity, network topology, and spectral power. We also ran further baseline comparisons between the MDD patients and a cohort of healthy controls (n = 22). Network-based connectivity analysis revealed a functional subnetwork of significantly increased theta connectivity spanning frontal and parieto-occipital channels following MST. The change in theta connectivity was further found to predict clinical response to treatment. An additional widespread subnetwork of reduced beta connectivity was also elucidated. Graph-based topological analyses showed an increase in functional network segregation and reduction in integration in the theta band, with a decline in segregation in the beta band. Finally, delta and theta power were significantly elevated following treatment, while gamma power declined. No baseline differences between MDD patients and healthy subjects were observed. These results highlight widespread changes in resting-state brain dynamics following a course of MST in MDD patients, with changes in theta connectivity providing a potential physiological marker of treatment response.

This association was found to be predictive of responsiveness to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment. Such findings suggest that DLPFC-SGC connectivity is important for understanding both the therapeutic mechanism of rTMS in patients with MDD and the underlying pathophysiology of MDD. Objective: To evaluate SGC hyperactivity in patients with MDD before and after rTMS treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants In this diagnostic study, among participants recruited from the adult and geriatric mood and anxiety services at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, who had participated in a randomized clinical trial, baseline SGC activity of patients with MDD was compared with healthy controls. In patients with MDD, SGC activity was compared before and after active or sham high-frequency rTMS treatment. Data collection started in July 2008 and concluded in March 2012. Neurophysiological data analysis started in January 2017 and ended in May 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures Hyperactivity in the SGC before and after rTMS treatment was measured. Subgenual cingulate cortex hyperactivity activity was quantified using significant current density (SCD), and effective connectivity between the left DLPFC and SGC was computed using significant current scattering (SCS). Both measures were computed around TMS evoked potentials standard peak latencies prior to rTMS and after rTMS treatment, comparing patients with MMD treated with active and sham rTMS. Patients with MDD were assessed with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Results: Of 121 patients with MDD in the initial trial, 30 (15 [50.0%] women) were compared with 30 healthy controls (15 [50.0%] women) at rTMS treatment baseline. The mean (SD) age of the cohort with MDD was 39.1 (10.9) years, and the mean (SD) age of healthy controls was 37.0 (11.0) years. Following rTMS treatment, 26 patients with MDD who had active rTMS treatment (21.5%) were compared with 17 patients with MDD who had sham treatment (14.0%). At baseline, the SGC mean (SD) SCD and mean (SD) SCS at 200 milliseconds after TMS pulse were higher in participants with MDD compared with healthy controls (SCD: 1.04 × 10−6 [1.41 × 10−6] μA/mm2 vs 3.8 × 10−7 [7.8 × 10−7] μA/mm2; z = –2.95; P = .004; SCS: 0.87 [0.86] mm vs 0.54 [0.87] mm; z = –2.27; P = .02). Baseline source current density was able to classify MDD with 77% accuracy. Scores on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression were correlated with current density at the SGC (ρ = 0.41; P = .03). After rTMS treatment, SGC mean (SD) SCD and mean (SD) SCS at 200 milliseconds after rTMS pulse were attenuated to approximately the standard TMS-evoked potential latencies in the active rTMS group compared with the sham rTMS group (SCD: 1.57 × 10−7 [3.67 × 10−7] μA/mm2 vs 7.00 × 10−7 [7.51 × 10−7] μA/mm2; z = −2.91; P = .004; SCS: 0.20 [0.44] mm vs 0.74 [0.73] mm; z = −2.78; P = .006). Additionally, the SGC SCS change was correlated with symptom improvement on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression in the active rTMS group (ρ = 0.58; P = .047). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study further implicate left DLPFC-SGC effective connectivity and SGC excitability in the pathophysiology of MDD and treatment with rTMS. These findings suggest that DLPFC-SGC connectivity may be a marker of rTMS treatment responsiveness.

The initiation of cortical activation or its modulation depends on the background activation of the neurons of the cortical region activated, the characteristics of the coil, its position and its orientation with respect to the head. TMS combined with simultaneous electrocephalography (EEG) and neuronavigation (nTMS-EEG) allows for the assessment of cortico-cortical excitability and connectivity in almost all cortical areas in a reproducible manner. This advance makes nTMS-EEG a powerful tool that can accurately assess brain dynamics and neurophysiology in test-retest paradigms that are required for clinical trials. Limitations of this method include artifacts that cover the initial brain reactivity to stimulation. Thus, the process of removing artifacts may also extract valuable information. Moreover, the optimal parameters for dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) stimulation are not fully known and current protocols utilize variations from the motor cortex (M1) stimulation paradigms. However, evolving nTMS-EEG designs hope to address these issues. The protocol presented here introduces some standard practices for assessing neurophysiological functioning from stimulation to the DLPFC that can be applied in patients with treatment resistant psychiatric disorders that receive treatment such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), magnetic seizure therapy (MST) or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2017</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="hadar_answering_2017" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Answering the missed call: Initial exploration of cognitive and electrophysiological changes associated with smartphone use and abuse</div> <div class="author"> Aviad Hadar, <em>Itay Hadas</em>, Avi Lazarovits, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

Recent studies associate extensive usage with a range of debilitating effects. We sought to determine whether excessive usage is accompanied by measurable neural, cognitive and behavioral changes. Method Subjects lacking previous experience with smartphones (n = 35) were compared to a matched group of heavy smartphone users (n = 16) on numerous behavioral and electrophysiological measures recorded using electroencephalogram (EEG) combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the right prefrontal cortex (rPFC). In a second longitudinal intervention, a randomly selected sample of the original non-users received smartphones for 3 months while the others served as controls. All measurements were repeated following this intervention. Results Heavy users showed increased impulsivity, hyperactivity and negative social concern. We also found reduced early TMS evoked potentials in the rPFC of this group, which correlated with severity of self-reported inattention problems. Heavy users also obtained lower accuracy rates than nonusers in a numerical processing. Critically, the second part of the experiment revealed that both the numerical processing and social cognition domains are causally linked to smartphone usage. Conclusion Heavy usage was found to be associated with impaired attention, reduced numerical processing capacity, changes in social cognition, and reduced right prefrontal cortex (rPFC) excitability. Memory impairments were not detected. Novel usage over short period induced a significant reduction in numerical processing capacity and changes in social cognition.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2016</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="hadas_exposure_2016" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Exposure to salient, dynamic sensory stimuli during development increases distractibility in adulthood</div> <div class="author"> <em>Itay Hadas</em>, Ram Gal, Lihi Bokovza, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?
