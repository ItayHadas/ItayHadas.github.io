# Neurophysiological Biomarkers for Neuromodulation in Treatment-Resistant Depression
As a neuroscientist driven by the challenge of unraveling depression's neural circuits, my work has centered on developing circuit-specific biomarkers using transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) to guide and optimize neuromodulation therapies for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). This aligns seamlessly with my research interests in mechanistic neurophysiological markers and targeted interventions, as detailed in my statement of research interests. From my postdoctoral tenure at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) to my role at UC San Diego, where I helped establish the Interventional Psychiatry Program, I have led and contributed to studies validating subgenual cingulate cortex (SGC) hyperactivity and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)-SGC connectivity as pivotal features of TRD. These biomarkers not only illuminate depression's pathophysiology but also inform personalized treatments like repetitive TMS (rTMS) and magnetic seizure therapy (MST). Looking ahead, I envision extending this to accelerated intermittent theta-burst stimulation (aiTBS) protocols, integrating multimodal data for real-time targeting, to advance clinical outcomes.
A cornerstone of my research is the theoretical anticorrelation between the left DLPFC and SGC, where TMS pulses to the DLPFC may modulate SGC activity transsynaptically, normalizing hyperactivity linked to depressive symptoms.

In an early study I led, we used TMS-EEG to probe SGC hyperactivity and DLPFC-SGC effective connectivity in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients before and after high-frequency rTMS {% cite hadas_association_2019 %}. Quantifying SGC activity via significant current density (SCD) and connectivity via significant current scattering (SCS), we found elevated baseline measures in MDD versus controls, with SCD classifying MDD at 77% accuracy. Active rTMS reduced these toward normal levels, correlating baseline SCD with Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17) scores (ρ = 0.41, P = .03) and SCS changes with symptom relief (ρ = 0.58, P = .047). This was among the first demonstrations of TMS-EEG capturing causal connectivity shifts, positioning DLPFC-SGC dysregulation as a viable therapeutic target.

Extending this to MST, another neuromodulation approach with reduced cognitive side effects, I spearheaded a study showing post-MST reductions in DLPFC-SGC SCS (P < .036), correlating with HRSD-24 improvements (ρ = 0.46, P < .031) {% cite hadas_subgenual_2020 %}. Hippocampal (Hipp) SCD also decreased (P < .015), linking to Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) changes (ρ = -0.59, P < .026). This dissociated efficacy mechanisms (SGC-DLPFC connectivity) from cognitive impacts (Hipp activation), underscoring TMS-EEG's value for treatment monitoring.

Building on these foundations, I contributed to a multimodal study integrating resting-state functional MRI (RSFC) with TMS-EEG in 42 TRD patients undergoing individualized aiTBS [Sun et al., 2025]. We found that more negative baseline RSFC between the DLPFC target and SGC correlated with smaller (less negative) N100 amplitudes (Spearman’s ρ = -0.37, P = 0.02) and reduced cortical evoked activity (CEA) in the SGC (ρ = 0.29, P = 0.07). This suggests stronger DLPFC-SGC anticorrelation reflects enhanced inhibitory control, allowing DLPFC-targeted TMS to better suppress SGC activity. Reconciling prior findings—where higher SGC TMS-EEG activation signals worse depression, but negative RSFC predicts better outcomes—this work bridges modalities, supporting personalized targeting without invasive methods.

These projects, where I served as first author on the foundational TMS-EEG studies and collaborator on multimodal extensions, highlight my proficiency in biomarker pipelines—from data acquisition to analysis. They fuel my future directions, such as optimizing aiTBS via real-time TMS-EEG feedback, as outlined in my cover letter. By translating these insights from bench to bedside, including my consulting at Deliberate.ai for AI-driven diagnostics, I aim to revolutionize TRD care through innovative, cross-disciplinary science.
