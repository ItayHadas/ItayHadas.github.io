# Neurophysiological Biomarkers and Mechanisms of Convulsive Therapies in Treatment-Resistant Depression

Neurophysiological Biomarkers and Mechanisms of Convulsive Therapies in Treatment-Resistant Depression
In my postdoctoral and research scientist roles at CAMH (Toronto) and UC San Diego Health, I investigated the neural mechanisms of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and magnetic seizure therapy (MST) in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) using resting-state EEG (RS-EEG) and TMS-EEG. My contributions included leading data analysis, biomarker development, and linking neural dynamics to clinical outcomes.
Our work began by examining RS-EEG changes following ECT, a highly effective but cognitively burdensome intervention for MDD. In a cohort of 23 patients, we observed enhanced functional connectivity in lower frequency bands (delta and theta) within fronto-central subnetworks, alongside widespread reductions in beta-band connectivity post-treatment. Graph-theoretic analyses revealed increased network segregation (higher clustering coefficient) and reduced integration (longer characteristic path length) in delta/theta bands, with opposite shifts in beta, suggesting ECT promotes a more modular, less globally integrated network architecture that may underlie its antidepressant effects {% cite hill_modulation_2020 %}. These alterations align with clinical "slowing" observed in EEG, potentially reflecting enhanced inhibitory processes in prefrontal circuits implicated in MDD pathophysiology.
In parallel, we extended this to MST, a more focal convulsive therapy with fewer cognitive side effects, in 21 MDD patients. RS-EEG post-MST showed a distinct subnetwork of increased theta connectivity spanning frontal and parieto-occipital regions, coupled with broader beta-band reductions. Topological changes mirrored ECT in part, with greater theta segregation and reduced beta integration, and theta connectivity changes predicted clinical response (measured via Hamilton Depression Rating Scale reductions). This highlights MST's potential to modulate similar oscillatory mechanisms as ECT but with greater spatial precision, possibly sparing deeper limbic structures like the hippocampus {% cite hill_resting-state_2020 %}.
To delve deeper into cortical reactivity, we employed TMS-EEG, applying single-pulse TMS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and primary motor cortex (M1) in 38 MDD patients before and after convulsive therapy (24 MST, 14 ECT). At baseline, MDD patients exhibited elevated oscillatory power in delta, theta, and alpha bands over DLPFC compared to healthy controls, indicating heightened low-frequency activity in depression-related circuits. Post-treatment, both ECT and MST attenuated delta/theta power over DLPFC, with ECT additionally reducing alpha power; MST showed no significant M1 changes, while ECT reduced delta/theta there. Notably, alpha power reductions correlated with improved depression severity scores, suggesting TMS-EEG as a sensitive probe for treatment-induced plasticity {% cite hill_characterizing_2021 %}.

Power is shown in decibels relative to pre-stimulus baseline, with the TMS pulse at time zero (dotted blue line). Green boxes indicate analysis windows for cluster-based statistics, revealing post-TMS power increases in delta/theta/alpha (20–300 ms) and beta/gamma (20–150 ms) bands.

Building on these oscillatory findings, a recent study revisited "clinical slowing" through the lens of aperiodic (non-oscillatory) EEG components, which reflect broadband neural excitation-inhibition balance. In combined ECT (n=23) and MST (n=21) cohorts, we found significant increases in aperiodic activity (steeper spectral slopes) post-treatment, particularly frontally, independent of periodic oscillations. This elevation—linked to greater inhibition—did not directly correlate with remission in this sample but suggests a shared inhibitory mechanism across therapies, potentially explaining their anticonvulsant properties and therapeutic efficacy {% cite smith_magnetic_2023-1 %}.

These studies collectively demonstrate that ECT and MST induce widespread, frequency-specific modulations in neural dynamics, with low-frequency enhancements and high-frequency attenuations potentially serving as biomarkers for response. My involvement in developing automated EEG pipelines and validating these markers has informed my future directions: integrating TMS-EEG with advanced imaging (e.g., fMRI/DTI) for circuit-targeted interventions, as pursued in my NARSAD Young Investigator Award and Baszucki Brain Research Grant. This work not only bridges translational neuroscience with clinical application but also paves the way for less invasive, personalized depression treatments—key to my aspirations in academia and industry collaborations, such as those with Deliberate.ai.
