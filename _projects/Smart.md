## Introduction

A set of experiments in both animals and humans that establish a causal link between chronic exposure to dynamic, attention-grabbing stimuli and alterations in brain function, particularly in executive control. These findings are highly relevant to the widespread use of electronic media among young adults.

### Smartphone Use and Attentional Behavior: A Translational Study

Using a translational approach, I investigated how exposure to attention-grabbing pervasive media affects human attention, focusing on smartphones given their ubiquitous presence in daily life and demonstrated capacity to capture attention. I conducted a two-phase study examining their impact on ADHD-related behaviors.
- Phase 1 (Correlational) {% cite hadar_answering_2017 %}: From 2,711 online questionnaire respondents, I recruited 16 heavy smartphone users and compared them to 35 non-users (individuals with only non-smartphones) using validated ADHD assessments: the CAARS questionnaire, EEG recordings during a stop-signal inhibitory control task, TMS concurrent with EEG (TMS-EEG) to causally extract neurophysiological properties such as inhibition and excitation metrics from specific brain circuits in a temporally and anatomically precise manner, and an information processing capacity test.
- Phase 2 (Interventional): Non-users were randomly divided into control (n=7, continued non-smartphone use) and intervention (n=8, received smartphones) groups. After six months, both groups were re-assessed using identical measures to establish causality.
Key Findings: Heavy users initially showed greater inattentiveness, impulsiveness, ADHD symptoms, and reduced arithmetic processing compared to non-users. Experimentally, smartphone exposure caused significant increases in inattentiveness, reaction-time variability during inhibitory control tasks, and brain activity patterns resembling ADHD pathophysiology.
Implications: These results demonstrate a causal relationship between smartphone use and executive dysfunction characteristic of ADHD. The impaired response inhibition observed represents an ADHD endophenotype linked to maladaptive approach behaviors toward environmental stimuli, suggesting smartphones may alter how individuals attribute incentive salience to stimuli.
