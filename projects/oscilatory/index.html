My contributions included leading data analysis, biomarker development, and linking neural dynamics to clinical outcomes. Our work began by examining RS-EEG changes following ECT, a highly effective but cognitively burdensome intervention for MDD. In a cohort of 23 patients, we observed enhanced functional connectivity in lower frequency bands (delta and theta) within fronto-central subnetworks, alongside widespread reductions in beta-band connectivity post-treatment. Graph-theoretic analyses revealed increased network segregation (higher clustering coefficient) and reduced integration (longer characteristic path length) in delta/theta bands, with opposite shifts in beta, suggesting ECT promotes a more modular, less globally integrated network architecture that may underlie its antidepressant effects <a class="citation" href="#hill_modulation_2020">(Hill et al., 2020)</a>. These alterations align with clinical “slowing” observed in EEG, potentially reflecting enhanced inhibitory processes in prefrontal circuits implicated in MDD pathophysiology. In parallel, we extended this to MST, a more focal convulsive therapy with fewer cognitive side effects, in 21 MDD patients. RS-EEG post-MST showed a distinct subnetwork of increased theta connectivity spanning frontal and parieto-occipital regions, coupled with broader beta-band reductions. Topological changes mirrored ECT in part, with greater theta segregation and reduced beta integration, and theta connectivity changes predicted clinical response (measured via Hamilton Depression Rating Scale reductions). This highlights MST’s potential to modulate similar oscillatory mechanisms as ECT but with greater spatial precision, possibly sparing deeper limbic structures like the hippocampus <a class="citation" href="#hill_resting-state_2020">(Hill et al., 2020)</a>. To delve deeper into cortical reactivity, we employed TMS-EEG, applying single-pulse TMS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and primary motor cortex (M1) in 38 MDD patients before and after convulsive therapy (24 MST, 14 ECT). At baseline, MDD patients exhibited elevated oscillatory power in delta, theta, and alpha bands over DLPFC compared to healthy controls, indicating heightened low-frequency activity in depression-related circuits. Post-treatment, both ECT and MST attenuated delta/theta power over DLPFC, with ECT additionally reducing alpha power; MST showed no significant M1 changes, while ECT reduced delta/theta there. Notably, alpha power reductions correlated with improved depression severity scores, suggesting TMS-EEG as a sensitive probe for treatment-induced plasticity <a class="citation" href="#hill_characterizing_2021">(Hill et al., 2021)</a>. Figure 1: Time-frequency power plots of TMS-related oscillatory activity. Averaged across cohorts and time-points for stimulation over (A) DLPFC (electrode F3) and (B) M1 (electrode C3). Power is shown in decibels relative to pre-stimulus baseline, with the TMS pulse at time zero (dotted blue line). Green boxes indicate analysis windows for cluster-based statistics, revealing post-TMS power increases in delta/theta/alpha (20–300 ms) and beta/gamma (20–150 ms) bands. Adapted from supplementary materials in <a class="citation" href="#hill_characterizing_2021">(Hill et al., 2021)</a>. Building on these oscillatory findings, a recent study revisited “clinical slowing” through the lens of aperiodic (non-oscillatory) EEG components, which reflect broadband neural excitation-inhibition balance. In combined ECT (n=23) and MST (n=21) cohorts, we found significant increases in aperiodic activity (steeper spectral slopes) post-treatment, particularly frontally, independent of periodic oscillations. This elevation—linked to greater inhibition—did not directly correlate with remission in this sample but suggests a shared inhibitory mechanism across therapies, potentially explaining their anticonvulsant properties and therapeutic efficacy <a class="citation" href="#smith_magnetic_2023-1">(Smith et al., 2023)</a>.

Flowchart detailing participant enrollment, allocation, and analysis in the original MST trial, with 24 patients providing complete TMS-EEG data pre- and post-treatment. This subset formed the basis for our oscillatory analyses. Adapted from supplementary materials in <a class="citation" href="#hill_characterizing_2021">(Hill et al., 2021)</a>. These studies collectively demonstrate that ECT and MST induce widespread, frequency-specific modulations in neural dynamics, with low-frequency enhancements and high-frequency attenuations potentially serving as biomarkers for response. My involvement in developing automated EEG pipelines and validating these markers has informed my future directions: integrating TMS-EEG with advanced imaging (e.g., fMRI/DTI) for circuit-targeted interventions, as pursued in my NARSAD Young Investigator Award and Baszucki Brain Research Grant. This work not only bridges translational neuroscience with clinical application but also paves the way for less invasive, personalized depression treatments—key to my aspirations in academia and industry collaborations, such as those with Deliberate.ai.</p> </article> <h2>References</h2> <div class="publications"> <h2 class="bibliography">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="smith_magnetic_2023-1" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Magnetic seizure therapy and electroconvulsive therapy increase aperiodic activity</div> <div class="author"> Sydney E.

One of the most efficacious treatments for treatment-resistant MDD is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Recently, magnetic seizure therapy (MST) was developed as an alternative to ECT due to its more favorable side effect profile. While these approaches have been very successful clinically, the neural mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects are unknown. For example, clinical “slowing” of the electroencephalogram beginning in the postictal state and extending days to weeks post-treatment has been observed in both treatment modalities. However, a recent longitudinal study of a small cohort of ECT patients revealed that, rather than delta oscillations, clinical slowing was better explained by increases in aperiodic activity, an emerging EEG signal linked to neural inhibition. Here we investigate the role of aperiodic activity in a cohort of patients who received ECT and a cohort of patients who received MST treatment. We find that aperiodic neural activity increases significantly in patients receiving either ECT or MST. Although not directly related to clinical efficacy in this dataset, increased aperiodic activity is linked to greater amounts of neural inhibition, which is suggestive of a potential shared neural mechanism of action across ECT and MST.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="hill_characterizing_2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Characterizing Cortical Oscillatory Responses in Major Depressive Disorder Before and After Convulsive Therapy: A TMS-EEG Study</div> <div class="author"> Aron T.

Here, we utilized time-frequency analyses to characterize differences in neural oscillatory dynamics between subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls (HC). We further examined changes in TMS-related oscillatory power following convulsive therapy. Methods Oscillatory power was examined following TMS over the dorsolateral prefrontal and motor cortices (DLPFC and M1) in 38 MDD subjects, and 22 HCs. We further investigated how these responses changed in the MDD group following an acute course of convulsive therapy (either magnetic seizure therapy [MST, n = 24] or electroconvulsive therapy [ECT, n = 14]). Results Prior to treatment, MDD subjects exhibited increased oscillatory power within delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands with TMS-EEG over the DLPFC, but showed no differences to HCs with stimulation over M1. Following MST, DLPFC stimulation revealed attenuated baseline-normalized power in the delta and theta bands, with reductions in the delta, theta, and alpha power following ECT. TMS over M1 revealed reduced delta and theta power following ECT, with no changes observed following MST. An association was also observed between the treatment- induced change in alpha power and depression severity score. Limitations Limitations include the modest sample size, open-label MST and ECT treatment designs, and lack of a placebo condition. Conclusions These results provide evidence of alterations in TMS-related oscillatory activity in MDD, and further suggest modulation of oscillatory power following ECT and MST.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="hill_modulation_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Modulation of functional network properties in major depressive disorder following electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): a resting-state EEG analysis</div> <div class="author"> Aron T.

Presently, however, understanding of its neurophysiological effects remains incomplete. In the present study, we utilised resting-state electroencephalography (RS-EEG) to explore changes in functional connectivity, network topology, and spectral power elicited by an acute open-label course of ECT in a cohort of 23 patients with treatment-resistant MDD. RS-EEG was recorded prior to commencement of ECT and again within 48 h following each patient’s final treatment session. Our results show that ECT was able to enhance connectivity within lower (delta and theta) frequency bands across subnetworks largely confined to fronto-central channels, while, conversely, more widespread subnetworks of reduced connectivity emerged within faster (alpha and beta) bands following treatment. Graph-based topological analyses revealed changes in measures of functional segregation (clustering coefficient), integration (characteristic path length), and small-world architecture following ECT. Finally, post-treatment enhancement of delta and theta spectral power was observed, which showed a positive association with the number of ECT sessions received. Overall, our findings indicate that RS-EEG can provide a sensitive measure of dynamic neural activity following ECT and highlight network-based analyses as a promising avenue for furthering mechanistic understanding of the effects of convulsive therapies.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="hill_resting-state_2020" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Resting-state electroencephalographic functional network alterations in major depressive disorder following magnetic seizure therapy</div> <div class="author"> Aron T.

However, the underlying mechanism of action of MST remains uncertain. Here, we used resting-state electroencephalography (RS-EEG) to characterise the physiological effects of MST for treatment resistant MDD. We recorded RS-EEG in 21 patients before and after an open label trial of MST applied over the prefrontal cortex using a bilateral twin coil. RS-EEG was analysed for changes in functional connectivity, network topology, and spectral power. We also ran further baseline comparisons between the MDD patients and a cohort of healthy controls (n = 22). Network-based connectivity analysis revealed a functional subnetwork of significantly increased theta connectivity spanning frontal and parieto-occipital channels following MST. The change in theta connectivity was further found to predict clinical response to treatment. An additional widespread subnetwork of reduced beta connectivity was also elucidated. Graph-based topological analyses showed an increase in functional network segregation and reduction in integration in the theta band, with a decline in segregation in the beta band. Finally, delta and theta power were significantly elevated following treatment, while gamma power declined. No baseline differences between MDD patients and healthy subjects were observed. These results highlight widespread changes in resting-state brain dynamics following a course of MST in MDD patients, with changes in theta connectivity providing a potential physiological marker of treatment response. Future prospective studies are required to confirm these initial findings.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </div> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container"> © Copyright 2025 Itay Hadas. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@5.0.0/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-htrLFfZJ6v5udOG+3kNLINIKh2gvoKqwEhHYfTTMICc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js?a0db7e5d5c70cc3252b3138b0c91dcaf" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?2781658a0a2b13ed609542042a859126"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?e0514a05c5c95ac1a93a8dfd5249b92e"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?c8a01c11a92744d44b093fc3bda915df" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.2/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js" integrity="sha256-MASABpB4tYktI2Oitl4t+78w/lyA+D7b/s9GEP0JOGI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/mathjax-setup.js?a5bb4e6a542c546dd929b24b8b236dfd"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-T4Q6QLKM09"></script> <script>
